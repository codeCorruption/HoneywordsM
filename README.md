# HoneywordsM
This repository contains the implementation and the code for formal verification of the protocol resilient to code-corruption described in the paper "A Security Analysis, and a Fix, of a Code-Corrupted Honeywords System", published in Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Information Systems Security and Privacy, ICISSP 2018.

The referred protocol keeps a Honeywords System working (i.e., detecting when password files are leaked) in the case that an intruder corrupts the login server's code.

The code corresponding to formal verifications performed in the extended version "A Critical Security Analysis of the Password-based Authentication Honeywords System Under Code-Corruption Attack" is also mantained here.
